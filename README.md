This is the backend part of our Grading System application

Steps to run this project:
1. Clone this project
2. Congratulations you can now use the front-end part of the grading system. Note that you must first run the
    back-end part of the system before running this front-end. Steps on how to do so: (This guide is done considering
    that you have already done the necessary things needed to run the back-end of the system):
    - Open two terminals for Visual Studio Code
    - Navigate to the backend directory for the first terminal then navigate 
        to the frontend directory for the second terminal
    - In the back-end terminal (Terminal used to navigate to the backend directory), run 'npm run dev' command
    - It should state Example app listening on port 5000! ðŸš€ðŸš€
    - Then, in the front-end terminal, run 'npm start' command
